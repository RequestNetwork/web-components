# Request Network Invoice Dashboard ðŸ“š

## Introduction

This package offers a Web Component for integrating the Request Network's Invoice Dashboard into web applications. It is built using Svelte but compiled to a Web Component, making it usable in any web environment, regardless of the framework

## Installation

To install the component, use npm:

```console
npm install @requestnetwork/invoice-dashboard
```

This command adds the Invoice Dashboard component to your project, allowing for easy integration into any web application.

## Usage

### In React Projects

To use in a React application, import `@requestnetwork/invoice-dashboard` and
use the component in your JSX. Configure the invoice-dashboard web component
by creating a reference to it and setting its properties. Unfortunately, it's
not possible to pass objects into a web component as props. See for details

This usage example uses [Web3 Onboard](https://onboard.blocknative.com/) to
connect a wallet but you can use any wallet connection method you prefer.

```tsx
import("@requestnetwork/invoice-dashboard");
import { useEffect, useRef } from "react";
import { config } from "@/utils/config";
import { InvoiceDashboardProps } from "@/types";
import { useConnectWallet } from "@web3-onboard/react";

export default function CreateRequestForm() {
  const [{ wallet }] = useConnectWallet() // Web3 Onboard
  const formRef = useRef<CreateRequestFormProps>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (wallet) {
      const { provider } = wallet;
      initRequestNetwork(provider)
    }
  }, [wallet]);

  const requestNetwork = new RequestNetwork({
    nodeConnectionConfig: {
      baseURL: "https://gnosis.gateway.request.network",
    },
    signatureProvider: new Web3SignatureProvider(provider),
    }
  )

  useEffect(() => {
    if (dashboardRef.current) {
      dashboardRef.current.config = config;

      if (wallet && requestNetwork) {
        dashboardRef.current.wallet = wallet;
        dashboardRef.current.requestNetwork = requestNetwork;
      }
    }
  }, [wallet, requestNetwork]);

  return (
    <div className="container m-auto  w-[100%]">
      <invoice-dashboard ref={dashboardRef} />
    </div>
  );
}
```
